The plot gives a clear distinction between bus, train and total ridership due to good colour choice. Also, the grid helps in making the plot more readable. The axis labels, legend and title is perfect!

The plot speaks a lot about CTA ridership and what I like more is that the code for it is nice and crisp, easy to understand nd done using matplotlib.

As mentioned before line plot speaks a lot about CTA ridership, I think bar plot would have been a better choice since it is a comparison.

It is mentioned in the caption that there was decrease in ridership first and then a increase, I think this change should have been marked clearly on the line plot so that it can be spotted in the first glance. That is why again bar plot would have been better.
